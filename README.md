# Creating_Internet_Application_Project

The system allows the sharing of works and portfolio between creators and companies,
therefore allowing them to get in touch through job advertisements. The users of the system
are: companies and content creators (like concept artists, 3D Modelers, etc).
In the sign in phase, the content creators as well as companies select the type of profile and
fill the required field.
The creation of an account by a content creator implies the creation of the portfolio which will
contain the user’s creations that will be posted on the system through a post. When creating
a post, among the different fields, the user inserts tags that specify the area of interest of
that post and a textual area as a description of its work. The portfolio, with its contents, will
be accessible by the user in the portfolio section where he can modify it.
The system allows the company to create posts with a job advertisement. Among the fields,
the post will contain tags of the area of interest of that job, the specifications of the job
proposal, eventually some brief description of the job, like its name, and the location of the
job. After the creation of the job, it will be shown to the company the users’ profiles that best
match the advertisement. The matching is based on the correlation between the work tags in
users’ portfolios and the job tags.
The content creator can apply to a job advertisement and the list of all his applications will be
shown in his profile section together with the applications that have been accepted or
refused. The companies will then access the list of the users applied to their proposal in its
profile section, and eventually access their portfolios. In case the company is interested in
the user's portfolio, it will be shown to the company the possibility to approve the application,
otherwise it will be rejected. If the application is approved, the company will have the
possibility to send to the user the information about an external meeting. Whenever the
company provides feedback about the proposal, a notification will be sent to the content
creator that has applied to the job.
Additionally the system provides a home where the user can visualize the posts created by
the other users, having the possibility to filter them in some ways, such as: chronological
order, by tags, etc... Moreover there will be shown a “Job” section with the job advertisement
that the user can filter according to its interests, and a “Search” bar to search creators or
companies. Companies can access the same contents in the home, except the “Job” section
that will not be displayed for them.
